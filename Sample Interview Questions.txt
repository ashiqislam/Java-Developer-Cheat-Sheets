JVM, or the Java Virtual Machine, is an interpreter which accepts ‘Bytecode’ and executes it. 
Java has been termed as a ‘Platform Independent Language’ as it primarily works on the notion of ‘compile once, run everywhere’. Here’s a sequential step establishing the Platform independence feature in Java:
•	The Java Compiler outputs Non-Executable Codes called ‘Bytecode’.
•	Bytecode is a highly optimized set of computer instruction which could be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

“JDK” stands for Java Development Kit. The JDK is a bundle of software that is used to develop Java based software.
“JRE” stands for the Java Runtime Environment. The JRE is an implementation of the Java Virtual Machine which actually executes Java programs.

What is the difference between STRINGBUFFER and STRING?
•	String object is immutable.
•	StringBuffer/StringBuilder objects are mutable.

Polymorphism allows an entity such as a variable, a function, or an object to have more than one form.

Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit.

Abstraction is the process of abstraction in Java is used to hide certain details and only show the essential features of the object.

Inheritance allows a class to use the properties and methods of another class.

Overriding is declaring a method in subclass which is already present in the parent class.
Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have two or more methods having same name.

Constructor is a block of code, which runs when you use new keyword in order to instantiate an object.
A constructor with no argument is known as default constructor in java.

What is Checked Exception in Java?
Checked Exception in Java is all those Exception which requires being catches and handled during compile time. If Compiler doesn’t see try or catch block handling a Checked Exception, it throws a Compilation error. –Example IOexception


What is Unchecked Exception in Java? 
Unchecked Exception in Java is those Exceptions whose handling is not verified during Compile time. Unchecked Exceptions mostly arise due to programming errors like accessing method of a null object, accessing element outside an array bonding or invoking method with illegal arguments.  –example ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception
A difference between Checked and UnChecked Exception is that checked Exception requires mandatory try catch or try finally block but unchecked Exception don't.

FileInputStream contains the input byte from a file and implements an input stream.
FileOutputStream uses for writing data to a file and also implements an output stream.

FileReader : The FileReader class makes it possible to read the contents of a file as a stream of characters. It works much like the FileInputStream, except the FileInputStream reads bytes, whereas the FileReader reads characters.
FileWriter : This class is used to write to character files. Creation of a FileWriter is not dependent on the file already existing. 

int c;
FileReader fread = new FileReader("xanadu.txt");
FileWriter fwrite = new FileWriter("characteroutput.txt");
while ((c = fread.read()) != -1)
       fwrite.write(c);

An ArrayList is a dynamic data structure, meaning items can be added and removed from the list. A normal array in java is a static data structure, because you stuck with the initial size of your array. 
In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements, called nodes pointing to the next node by means of a pointer.
ArrayList search operation is pretty fast compared to the LinkedList search operation.
ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data while LinkedList is better for manipulating data.
Iterator also allows you to remove elements from collection during traversal but Enumeration doesn't allow that, it doesn't got the remove() method. Enumeration is also a legacy class and not all Collection supports it e.g. Vector supports Enumeration but ArrayList doesn't.
