What is the difference between STRINGBUFFER and STRING?
•	String object is immutable.
•	StringBuffer/StringBuilder objects are mutable.

Method overriding is declaring a method in a subclass which is already present in the parent class.
Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have two or more methods to have the same name.

An interface is a reference type, its a collection of abstract methods. 
A class implements an interface, thereby inheriting the abstract methods of the interface.

Constructor is a special member of a class which is used to create the objects to the class using the new keyword.
 A constructor with no argument is known as default constructor in java.

What is Checked Exception in Java?
Checked Exception in Java are Exceptions which requires being catches and handled during compile time. 
If Compiler doesn’t see try or catch block handling a Checked Exception, it throws a Compilation error. –Example IOexception


What is Unchecked Exception in Java? 
Unchecked Exception in Java are Exceptions whose handling is not verified during Compile time. Unchecked Exceptions mostly arise due to 
programming errors like accessing method of a null object, accessing element outside an array bonding or invoking method with illegal arguments.  
–example ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception

A difference between Checked and UnChecked Exception is that checked Exception requires mandatory try catch or try finally block 
but unchecked Exception don't.

FileInputStream contains the input byte from a file and implements an input stream.
FileOutputStream uses for writing data to a file and also implements an output stream.

FileReader : The FileReader class makes it possible to read the contents of a file as a stream of characters. 
It works much like the FileInputStream, except the FileInputStream reads bytes, whereas the FileReader reads characters.

FileWriter : This class is used to write to character files. Creation of a FileWriter is not dependent on the file already existing.
