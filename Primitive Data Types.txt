JVM, or the Java Virtual Machine, is an interpreter which accepts ‘Bytecode’ and executes it. 
Java has been termed as a ‘Platform Independent Language’ as it primarily works on the notion of ‘compile once, run everywhere’.

•	The Java Compiler outputs Non-Executable Codes called ‘Bytecode’.
•	Bytecode is a highly optimized set of computer instruction which could be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

“JDK” stands for Java Development Kit. The JDK is a bundle of software that is used to develop Java based software.
 “JRE” stands for the Java Runtime Environment. The JRE is an implementation of the Java Virtual Machine which actually executes Java programs.

Int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer. For whole numbers.
•	Min value is -2,147,483,647).(-2^31)
•	Maximum value is 2,147,483,647(inclusive).(2^31 -1)

Double data type is a double-precision 64-bit standard floating point. (IEEE 754)
•	This data type is generally used as the default data type for decimal values, generally the default choice.

Short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. Used to save space like byte.
•	Minimum value is -32,768 (-2^15)
•	Maximum value is 32,767 (inclusive) (2^15 -1)

Byte data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer. Used to save space in large arrays.
•	Minimum value is -128 (-2^7)
•	Maximum value is 127 (inclusive)(2^7 -1)

Long data type is a 64-bit signed two's complement integer. For longer numbers than ints.
•	Minimum value is -9,223,372,036,854,775,808.(-2^63)
•	Maximum value is 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (inclusive). (2^63 -1)

Strings is a data type that can hold a sequence of characters.
Boolean holds either True or False.

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CLASS, METHOD AND OBJECT.
A class is a construct that defines a collection of properties and methods. 
A method is a set of code which is referred to by name and can be called.
Objects are instances of a class.
